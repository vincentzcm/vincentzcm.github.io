The Interval Cycles technique pitch structure resource includes a widely used, such as: chromatic, diatonic, eight sounds scale, pentatonic scale, six sound scale, diatonic scale,Olivier Messiaen limited trans postions modes, and many other pitch structure resources.From the perspective of the classification and parametric algorithm of interval cycles by Edward Gollin, an American Musical Theorist, in my this paper studies the properties of non-multiple Aggregate interval cycles including Messiaen’s limited transpostions modes patterns and their relations with limited transpostions modes patterns.</p><h2 id="Tag"><a href="#Tag" class="headerlink" title="Tag:"></a>Tag:</h2><p>Interval Cycles; Compound Interval Cycle; Multi-Aggregate Cycles;Messiaen’s Limited Transpostions Modes</p><a id="more"></a><p>In the past 100 years of music creation and research, mathematical and physical logic as a trend, but also a more rational way of thinking affects the composition and analysis of composers and music theorists. Among them, interval circulation has been widely used in the works of composers such as Bartok and Ives, as a kind of mathematical logic of post-modern music in terms of pitch structure. In theory, the classification of interval cycles and related operations are becoming more and more perfect with the efforts of contemporary theorists such as American theorist Edward Gollin.</p><p>In the following, I mainly uses the relevant features described by Edward Gollin for the non-multiple Aggregate interval cycle and the related operations he puts forward to make a new interpretation of the limited transpostions mode that is widely known by French composer Messiaen from the perspective of interval cycle , And expand the new limited transpostions mode and form an algorithm, and at the same time innovate and research on the method and logic of splitting the same limited shift mode into different non-multiple cluster intervals.</p><h2 id="1-Isomorphic-relationship-between-Non-multiple-Aggregate-Interval-Cycles-and-Limited-transpostion-mode"><a href="#1-Isomorphic-relationship-between-Non-multiple-Aggregate-Interval-Cycles-and-Limited-transpostion-mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Isomorphic relationship between Non-multiple Aggregate Interval Cycles and Limited transpostion mode"></a>1. Isomorphic relationship between Non-multiple Aggregate Interval Cycles and Limited transpostion mode</h2><p>In a recent study by the American theorist Edward Gollin, it divides Compound interval cycles into two types of multi-Aggregate Interval Cycles and non-multi-Aggregate Interval Cycles. Edward Gollin defines multi-Aggregate Interval Cycles, which refers to those “interval groups that mix cycles with multiple intervals,” The phenomenon of returning to the original cycle point many times during the cycle, and finally reaching the starting point with the original interval cycle group value. “For example, Ord.PCI ((2,2,1) and (1,2, 2) or (2,1,2) constituted by the cycle (where Ord.PCI stands for ordered pitch intervals, the numbers separated by commas in parentheses represent the composition value of the interval cycle). See Figure 1. In Figure 1 Square brackets, pointed brackets, and ellipses respectively circled three types of cyclic Aggregate represented by pitch-class, so they are all multi-aggregate cycles.</p><p>Figure 1 (2,2,1) and (1,2,2) or (2,1,2) multiple aggregate cycles</p><p>Then the Non-multiple Aggregate Cycles refers to the phenomenon that the return to the original cycle point can be completed with the original interval cycle group value only once. For example: Ord.PCI (2), a single pitch cycle with a whole tone as the cycle value, constitutes a diatonic scale, and all its constituent sounds are represented by digital scales. If it is “0 2 4 6 8 10 0”, its subsequent recycling will continue. “0 2 4 6 8 10 0”. Another example: Ord.PCI (2,1,1) is “0 2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 0” and its subsequent cycle is also “0 2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 0”<br>According to the author’s experiment, the single interval cycle conforms to the characteristics of non-multiple aggregate cycles, while the mixed interval cycle must meet the characteristics that the sum of its cycle composition values cannot be prime with each other, and at the same time the calculated total number of sounds cannot exceed 12 In order to meet the characteristics of non-multiple aggregate cycles. The author pointed out in “On the Theory of Edward Gollin’s Interval Cycle Parameter Algorithm” that “all non-multiple aggreate cycles also conform to the logic of compound splitting on the basis of a single interval cycle.” Then at the digital level with modulo 12 as the logic In the case of calculation, we only need to consider the single interval level is only 1 to 6, because its complement with 12 has the same characteristics as the original interval level. Then, as long as it is divisible by 12 in the interval levels of 1 to 6, the mixed intervals can be split based on it, thereby forming a non-multiple cluster loop. Then there is only 5 in it, and the interval level 1 cannot be further subdivided, so it cannot be split into a new compound interval cycle. Of course, if the total number of sounds in a mixed interval loop is greater than 12, then multiple cluster loops will definitely be generated in the case of forming repeated digital levels, because the repeated digital levels will disrupt the original after the loop returns to the starting point. Cyclic group value.<br>Then the scale composed of a compound interval cycle with such characteristics has 1, unable to exhaust 12 semitones, 2, the sum of its cycle group value and 12 is not a prime number relationship, that is to say, according to Green’s sum of cycle group value SUM and 12 The greatest common divisor GCD can be used to express the number of its mode shifts logically, it contains only limited mode shift possibilities. Then this coincides with the scale logic of the limited shift mode proposed by the French composer Messiaen In Yang Liqing’s book “Sincerity, Elegance, and Sincerity-Messiaen’s Musical Language”, it is pointed out that “Messiaen’s finite shift pattern is composed of an octave divided into several equal parts by the same interval, with multiple cycles. The cells with the same structure have a limited possibility of displacement. “Then, by verifying the author’s conclusion, the existing finite displacement model of Messiaen is consistent with the characteristics of non-multiple aggregate cycles.</p><h2 id="2-The-algorithm-and-extension-of-non-multiple-Aggregate-interval-cycles-and-limited-transposition-mode"><a href="#2-The-algorithm-and-extension-of-non-multiple-Aggregate-interval-cycles-and-limited-transposition-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.

This cycle constitutes an octave scale, that is, the magnitude of the number of times of finite shift modulation in Messiah.<br>It is verified by the author that the algorithm is also applicable to the calculation of all Meixian finite shift modes. For example, Ord. PCI cycle of the fourth finite shift modulation mode of Meixi’an is 1,1,3,1. Then SUM = 6, GCD = 6, so this finite shift modulation includes 6 finite shifts.</p><h3 id="3-Non-multiple-cluster-interval-cycle-perspective-generates-a-new-limited-shift-pattern"><a href="#3-Non-multiple-cluster-interval-cycle-perspective-generates-a-new-limited-shift-pattern" class="headerlink" title="(3) Non-multiple cluster interval cycle perspective generates a new limited shift pattern"></a>(3) Non-multiple cluster interval cycle perspective generates a new limited shift pattern</h3><p>First of all, according to Edward’s theory of simplifying the mixing interval cycle, the sum of all the combined values of intervals in the finite shift mode is listed as SUM<br>Mode 1 diatonic Ord.PCI (2) SUM = 2<br>Mode 2 octave Ord.PCI (1,2) SUM = 3<br>Mode 3 Ord.PCI (2,1,1) SUM = 4<br>Mode 4 Ord.PCI (1,1,3,1) SUM = 6<br>Mode 5 Ord.PCI (1,4,1) SUM = 6<br>Mode 6 Ord.PCI (2,2,1,1) SUM = 6<br>Mode 7 Ord.PCI (1,1,1,2,1) SUM = 6<br>In this way, it can be found that if the above SUM value is Ord.PCI, a cycle is formed, that is, all the simplified cycles are single-tone cycles, and they cannot exhaust 12 semitones. At the same time, they are also non-prime. The author’s discussion of the characteristics of non-multiple aggregate cycles. In the case where Ord.PCI1, 5, 7, and 11 cannot be split, of course, Ord.PCI 2 cannot be split, so we can split Ord.PCI (3 ), Ord.PCI (4), Ord.PCI (6) These single intervals are new combinational logic to form a new limited shift mode.<br>Before the split, it is necessary to solve the problem of the order of occurrence of Ord.PCI in the loop formed in the Mesian finite shift modulation. According to Edward’s theory and experiment, Ord.PCI will not change in the interval cycle. The principle of the result. The author has verified that the theory is valid for only two different ordered intervals, and when splitting the ordered interval 6, there will be 1 + 2 + 3, which has 3 mutually different ordered intervals. In the case of elements, then the arrangement of these three mutually different elements in the circular space is only 2 groups as shown in Figure 2, the three groups of numbers divided by the three arrows to the left hemisphere are the same form 1 + 3 + 2 , 3 + 2 + 1,2 + 1 + 3; the three arrows to the right of the hemisphere divide another form: 1 + 2 + 3, 2 + 3 + 1, 3 + 1 + 2; There are only two sets of arrangements for the cycle of different ordered interval elements.</p><p>figure 2<br>At this point, we can start to generate a new limited shift pattern by way of interval rotation. After splitting Ord.PCI (3), Ord.PCI (4), Ord.PCI (6), these single intervals are new combinations. In logic, 3 can only be split into 1 + 2; therefore, only the interval number 4 and interval number 6 can be split, that is, 4 can be split into 1 + 3, 1 + 1 + 2; 6 can be split into 1 + 5, 1 + 4 + 1, 1 + 3 + 1 + 1, 1 + 3 + 2, 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1; 1 + 2 + 2 + 1; 2 + 4; thus comparing the patterns of Messi, 5 modes can be deduced, namely 1 + 3; 1 + 5; 1 + 3 + 2; 1 + 2 + 3; 2 + 4; we take 1 + 5 as an example, then SUM6 is firstly non-coprime and less than or equal 6. Secondly, after calculating GCD = 6 L = 4, the mode includes 6 finite shifts, and the number of sounds is 4 as follows:<br>(1,5) -Cycle 0 1 6 7 0 So this is a new limited-shift mode with 6 shifts, and the number of sounds is 4<br>Such new limited shift modes also include:<br>Hexascale Ord.PCI (1,3) –Cycle SUM = 4 d = 4 L = 6 Four shifts, number 6;<br>Ord.PCI (1,2,3) -Cycle 0 1 3 6 7 9 0 SUM = 6 d = 6 L = 6; Six shifts, sound number 6,<br>Ord.PCI (1,3,2) -cycle 0 1 4 6 7 10 0 SUM = 6 d = 6 L = 6, six shifts, number of sounds 6,<br>Ord.PCI (1,5) -Cycle 0 1 6 7 0 SUM = 6 d = 6 L = 4, 6 shifts, 4 sounds.<br>At this point, another five finite shift patterns have been generated.</p><h2 id="3-The-possibility-of-splitting-different-non-multiple-aggregate-intervals-with-the-same-limited-shift-mode"><a href="#3-The-possibility-of-splitting-different-non-multiple-aggregate-intervals-with-the-same-limited-shift-mode" class="headerlink" title="3. The possibility of splitting different non-multiple aggregate intervals with the same limited shift mode"></a>3. The possibility of splitting different non-multiple aggregate intervals with the same limited shift mode</h2><p>When you look at the finite shift mode in the form of interval cycles, you will find that the same finite shift mode can be split into different non-multiple cluster interval cycles.<br>For example, with (4,5) -cycle, the cycle generates an octave scale,<br>I.e. 0 4 9 1 6 T 3 7 0<br>At the same time Ord.PCI (1, 2) can also produce a same octave scale,<br>That is 0 1 3 4 6 7 9 T 0, it is verified that the two are the same scale structure.<br>Then we can find that the SUM values 9 and 3 of these two cycles are complementary in the modulo 12 space, that is, they are the same as the greatest common divisor of 12. Therefore, according to the formula for calculating the length of the double-cycle mixed cycle number provided by Edward “L = 2 (12 / d); d = GCD (12, SUM); SUM = x + y (mod12)”, their phone number must be The same, that is, when the value of d is unchanged, L is equivalent.<br>Therefore, we can split all the limited shift patterns as long as the number of sounds does not change, just make sure that the high-level results of each loop in the new loop appear in the original limited shift pattern only once. . The author here lists six other finite shift modes with non-multiple cluster loop characteristics except for the first finite shift mode of Messiaen’s first limited shift mode, and all available mixed interval cycles of the five newly generated limited shift modes. Split results. Only the original arrangement after splitting is listed in the result, and its transposed form can be obtained by sequentially shifting the first ordered interval to the end. For example, (1,8) cycle includes (8,1). (2,1,5) cycle its transposition includes (1,5,2) (5,2,1).<br>The author here lists all the possible splitting modes of the finite shift mode with non-multi-cluster cyclic properties as shown in the following table, and lists the calculation procedures in the appendix.</p><p>Limited transposition mode splits non-multiple Aggregate interval cycles list</p><h3 id="1-All-the-results-of-the-second-limited-transposition-mode-1-2-cycle"><a href="#1-All-the-results-of-the-second-limited-transposition-mode-1-2-cycle" class="headerlink" title="1.

The mixed interval loop cannot exhaust 12 semitones, and many features are consistent with the limited transposition mode. At the same time, 5 new types of limited transposition modes are obtained during the process of splitting Ord.PCI (4) and Ord.PCI (6). Combination of patterns. In the experiment of splitting the same finite shift mode into different non-multiple aggregate intervals, a list of 11 limited transposition modes split into different non-multiple aggregate cycles was obtained, and the algorithm process was summarized. The data in this table can be applied to creation and analysis research. At the same time, the classification table has an interpretation of the application of The list pitch-class sets theory in the interval cycles.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>转载内容</p><h2 id="何为自律-何为他律"><a href="#何为自律-何为他律" class="headerlink" title="何为自律 何为他律"></a>何为自律 何为他律</h2><a id="more"></a><p>　　他律论是与自律论相对而言的，二者在音乐本质认识上持截然相反的观点。他律论看重音乐的内容，强调音乐的内容美，也就是说他律论者提倡“情感论”，认为只有把这些精神性的内容注入到音乐中，并使其表达出情感的因素，才是真正的音乐艺术美。他律论认为音乐的规律和法则并不是靠音乐自身去维系和制约的，它还要受到外来因素的影响和制约，即情感，从这个意义上讲，音乐是他律的。他律一词，在康德哲学中是用来指人的意识是独立存在的，它不是由客观事物等外在的规律因素所决定的。这主要是因为音乐本身就体现着某种外在于音乐的客观实在，也就是说，音乐是一种内在的情感表达，它总是脱离音响结构这些外在形式束缚的某种东西。这种东西主要就是指人类的情感，即音乐的内容。正是这个情感、这个内容决定了音乐作品的音响结构、整体发展，决定了音乐的形式。由此，我们可以得出这样的结论——他律论强调内容，注重精神，它强调音乐是情感的完美表现。所以音乐的内容就是形象、情感、精神特征，其中以情感尤其重要。情感论美学作为西方音乐美学思想史上由众多理论体系和审美观念所构成的一支强大美学阵营，其产生和发展的历史却很短暂，所包含的内容也很单一。意大利当代著名音乐史学家恩里科·傅比尼在其所著的《音乐美学史》中，将情感论音乐美学作为一个历史范畴来看待，情感论音乐美学似乎是出现18世纪的一种美学观念。</p><h2 id="自律论与他律论的历史渊源"><a href="#自律论与他律论的历史渊源" class="headerlink" title="自律论与他律论的历史渊源"></a>自律论与他律论的历史渊源</h2><p>　　自律論音乐美学的出现并非偶然，早在古希腊时期，毕达哥拉斯学派就以“数”的比例关系来解释音乐美的做法，这就蕴含着某种偏重于形式的要素，强调音乐自身客观属性的音乐美学观念。毕达哥拉斯是古希腊著名的思想家、科学家，被人们誉为西方音乐美学思想的奠基人。人们通常把毕达哥拉斯和他的门徒们统称为毕达哥拉斯学派。毕达哥拉斯学派把“数”当作音乐的本源，认为音乐的基本法则是“数”的关系，提出音乐的美与和谐只能到“数”的关系中去寻找。毕达哥拉斯将其绝对化，并将其认为是音乐的本源。该学派还认为音乐的和谐是一种“普遍和谐”，这种和谐不仅仅是音乐的本质，而是整个宇宙的法则；不仅仅是外部世界的规律，而且也是人体内部世界（包括生理、心理方面）的秩序。柏拉图虽然是模仿论的倡导者，但他在论述音乐美时也常常从纯粹的形式因素着眼，他认为形式美按其本质来说应该是绝对的。在他看来，音乐的美在于音调在形式上的所谓“单整性”。从上述的这些现象中我们不难发现，并可以总结出自律论美学的一些思想观点，即自律论者是把外在的形式当作音乐的本质，它否认音乐的内容，否认音乐的情感表现功能。</p><p>　　古希腊时期的人们把音乐看成是科学、哲学、艺术的统一体，它既有娱乐的功能，同时它又与宗教、政治联系在一起，因此又具有一定的教化作用。受其观念的影响，在音乐领域出现了具有代表性的论说——模仿论，它在音乐美学思想中占据主导地位。于是处于这一时期的哲学家，无论是唯物主义还是唯心主义的哲学家们，他们都有一个共同点，就是把音乐看成是一种模仿，但是他们在对音乐模仿的对象这一问题的看法上产生较大分歧。</p><h2 id="自律与他律的对立统一"><a href="#自律与他律的对立统一" class="headerlink" title="自律与他律的对立统一"></a>自律与他律的对立统一</h2><p>　　他律与自律存在着对立的统一，音乐美的本质应走向他律与自律二元的综合。音乐美的本质兼有他律论与自律论的双重性，音乐有其自身固有的逻辑结构，即和声、旋律、节奏的组合，它不完全受欣赏者被唤起的想象、情感或联想的影响。从音响材料自身的物理属性上看，既有客观存在于音乐作品中的内容成分，又带有主观的因素，如体现为音乐的情感性、社会性等。各门艺术，无论文学还是音乐，如果单纯去追求他律或是自律，其结果必然会为它的另一面所否定。艺术始终浸染着情感因素，且与社会关系紧密联系，从这个层面上说，艺术是社会的产物，具有一定的他律性。同时，各门艺术又有其自身特定的形式构成，如用于绘画艺术的色彩、线条；作为文学艺术的语言；音乐艺术的音响、旋律等等，它们均具有自律性的一面。然而自律与他律作为对立着的两面，很难将它们合而为一。要解决这一难题还得回到二者的合理性和缺陷上来，从二者的对立性上来求统一，肯定他律与自律的合理因素，二者对立着的合理性统一了，二者的缺陷也就消失了。音乐既是人类情感的充分表现，又是乐音形式的艺术组合。<br>　　现代社会越来越进步，速度越来越快，这就要求作曲家在创作作品时，既要有动听的旋律又要能够体现出现代人能表达出来的思想感情，音乐形式往往伴随着音乐情感。作品的深层内涵就是情感的表达。所以不论是创作作品，还是演唱或者演奏作品都是“自律伦”与“他律论”的结合。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>《乐记》的核心内容是系统地论述了儒家的礼乐思想，全书有五篇将礼、乐并列加以论述。如“王者功成做作乐，治定制礼。”“乐者为同，礼者为异。”“乐统同，礼辨异。”“乐也者，情之不可变者也；礼也者，礼之不可易者也。”等等，对“礼”和“乐”的社会功能与作用及其相互关系第一次进行了全面而系统的理论总结，这是论述周代社会礼乐文化体系最具价值的灿烂篇章。</p><a id="more"></a><p>《乐记》对于音乐本质的解释，具有相当的深度。认为“凡音者，生人心者也。情动于中，故形于声；声成文，谓之音。”它肯定音乐是表达情感的艺术，又是声音的艺术，有着一种朴素的唯物主义观点的认识。<br>《乐记》强调音乐反映了国家的政治状况与社会风气，所谓“审乐以知政”：“是故治世之音安以乐，其政和；乱世之音怨以怒，其政乖；亡国之音哀以思，其民困。声音之道，与政通矣！”强调了音乐与政治、音乐与社会的密切关系，符合于当时巩固新兴封建统治阶级政权的时代要求。<br>《乐记》认为音乐是治理国家不可缺少的手段，所谓“先王立乐之方”，即“乐在宗庙之中，君臣上下同听之，则莫不和敬；在族长乡里之中，长幼同听之，则莫不和顺；在闺门之内，父子兄弟同听之，则莫不和亲。”提出“乐者，天地之和也。”的哲学主张，把音乐的谐和看作是宇宙万物谐和规律的体现。并将音乐与道德、法律、政治同等看待，“礼乐刑政，四达而不桲”，对音乐在国家上层建筑中所起的作用，给予了高度重视。<br>《乐记》还非常强调音乐的伦理教育作用，认为“是故先王之制礼乐也，非以极口腹耳目之欲也，将以教民平好恶，而返人道之正。”指出音乐必须接受政治、伦理道德的制约。<br>《乐记》对音乐美感的认识也有一定的深度。它反复强调“夫乐者，乐也，人情之所不能免也。”认为音乐应该使人产生愉悦的感受，是人类生活所不可缺少的。而且要运用音乐的美感来达到感染人、教育人的目的，所谓“足以感动人之善心而已矣。”对音乐以情感人的特点书中有不少阐述。但是，《乐记》对音乐审美观念的认识是以雅乐为最高标准的，有着明显的时代局限性。<br>关于在《乐记》的作者和成书年代，历来存在分歧。郭沫若认为是战国初期相传是孔子的再传弟子公孙尼子所作。更多学者以为此书出于汉儒之手。其中又有汉武帝时代的河间献王刘德（“河间献王好儒，与毛生等共采《周官》及诸子言乐事者以作《乐记》。”）一说和汉代刘向、刘歆父子校先秦古籍所得（“刘向校书，得《乐记》二十三篇。”）一说。二说均源于班固得《汉书•艺文志》。目前学术界多数赞同这样的观点：《乐记》成书于西汉，但其思想资料来源于先秦诸子言乐事者。<br>《乐记》这部理论著作两千多年来对于我国古代音乐的发展有着深刻影响，是我国音乐文化宝库中的一份珍贵遗产。</p>]]></content>
